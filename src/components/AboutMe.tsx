            Hi, I am Sudhanshu Srivastava. I fell in love with computers in a
            very early age of life. Grew up breaking them, then fixing them and
            finally breaking them again.
          </p>
            <p>
              Joined college with the goal of getting a career in Cyber
              Security. So started Front-end development for college clubs, then
              started doing CEH for knowledge in Cyber Sec (still doing ðŸ˜¢). And
              now learning backend development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Know blockchain basics, DevOps and whatever you want to throw at
              me, I WILL LEARN.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if you still donâ€™t know yet, I am really lazy and a serious
              procastinator.
